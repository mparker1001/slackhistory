----
Description
----
The "slackhistory" script will display the entire message history of a slack
channel (via *stdout*), but not the message content itself. This can be useful
if you want to pull user metrics.

----
Prerequisites
----

This was tested on PHP 5.5+. It may work on earlier versions, however.

----
Configuration
----
**Required:**
The Slack API token should be stored as an environment variable called
SLACK_API_TOKEN

For example, add the following to your .bash_profile file:
```
export SLACK_API_TOKEN="<token_value>"
```

**Optional, but highly recommended:**
You must set the timezone or PHP timezone warnings may appear. You can set your
time zone as an environment variable called SLACK_TIMEZONE (A list of timezones
can be found at http://php.net/manual/en/timezones.php).

For example, add the following to your .bash_profile file:
```
export SLACK_TIMEZONE="America/Chicago"
```

----
Usage
----
Execute the "slackhistory" file directly:
```
./slackhistory <channel_id>
```

For example:
```
./slackhistory U12345678
```

Another example but saving the output to a file:
```
./slackhistory U12345678 >> output.txt
```
